				exolve-preamble:
					<p>2020 has been a tough year for all, so here's a little variety cryptic that features some techniques for staying safe. In the UK, everyone is currently encouraged to observe three handy rules, each of which applies to 4 clues in this crossword:</p>
					<ol>
					<li><b>Hands</b> - Apply hand sanitiser to each clue: first solve the clue (ignoring an extraneous word), then remove the letters of a nasty hidden bug, then scrub the remaining letters together to form the grid entry, as defined by the extra word.</li>
					<li><b>Face</b> - Each clue is entered into the grid wearing a simple, fitted face mask (without ventilators, mind you), forming a new word.</li>
					<li><b>Space</b> - The two-word definition part of each clue is practicing social distancing by standing on either side of the cryptic part of the clue.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>For each clue, if it uses rule #N, circle the Nth letter of the Nth word of that clue. In clue order, the circled letters show what we can all use to make sense of 2020.</p>
