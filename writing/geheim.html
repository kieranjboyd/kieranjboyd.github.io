					<p>I wrote the story above back in 2016. It has the following properties:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It's in Standard Pilish (the number of letters per word follows a pattern derived from the digits of the mathematical constant Pi in decimal, as determined by Mike Keith)</li>
						<li>It's a lipogram (the letter 'e' does not appear once)</li>
						<li>No word is repeated throughout the text</li>
						<li>It contains each of the following:
							<ul>
								<li>a haiku</li>
								<li>an example of onomatopoeia</li>
								<li>a two-word palindrome (and two simple one-word palindromes too)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>It follows the additional "Section 12" rule from Mike Keith's Cadaeic Cadenza, in that the haiku:
							<ul>
								<li>is also an acrostic for the first few digits of Pi</li>
								<li>besides omitting 'e', does not contain the letter 'o' as a reference to the shape from which Pi is derived (although this particular rule sadly applies to the penultimate paragraph, not the antipenultimate...)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>It's exactly 55 words long, and can be therefore considered a valid piece of microfiction</li>
						<li>The title is both:
							<ul>
								<li>German/Dutch for "secret"</li>
								<li>the result of taking the first 6 digits of Pi (in decimal, including the leading 3), adding 4 to each, and taking that letter of the English alphabet</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>"In the spirit of Oulipo the constraint is reflected in the story itself": the text describes an author who has finished writing a lipogram, and who seeks to continue completing pieces of constrained writing despite their obvious fatigue</li>
							<ul>
								<li>This author might be Ernest Vincent Wright, who indeed wrote a "fifty thousand" word story that omitted the letter 'e', titled "Gadsby"</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
