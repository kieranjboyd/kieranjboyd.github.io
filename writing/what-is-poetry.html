							<p>Wait, so, what is poetry?</p>
							<p>Words that make you feel?</br>
							Sounds like a song</br>
							In both senses</br>
							But just the auditory one, right?</p>
							<p>Does it need to be written down?</br>
							Does it need to be read out?</br>
							What if I make a poem just in my head and think it to myself?</p>
							<p>Are we all poets?</br>
							Aren't we all poets?</p>
							<p>Do poems need repetition?</p>
							<p>What if I write this poem in my little Google Keep with my little rhetoricals but don't share it with anyone, is that a poem?</br>
							(Hey Google, define 'rhetoric')</p>
							<p>Does it need to be long?</br>
							If it's too short, surely there's a risk someone else has already said it</br>
							Something about having more time to write a shorter letter</br>
							But someone already said that</p>
							<p>But it makes you think</br>
							Is thinking a feeling?</br>
							Is a poem be something that makes you feel pensive?</br>
							Contemplative?</br>
							Damn, I was going for thoughtful</br>
							Someone already said that</p>
							<p>Ten Things I Hate About Poetry</br>
							Written by someone who wants to define what a poem is</br>
							In both senses</p>
							<p>In some senses, I'm a poet</br>
							(And I don't even ... realise that fact)</p>
							<p>The best part of poetry is that anyone can write any old line that doesn't even rhyme</br>
							But is the worst part when people trick themselves into thinking they're poet poets, you'll know</br>
							Something about prose and cons</br>
							And pros and cons</p>
							<p>Do poems need repetition?</br>
							In both senses</p>
							<p>Maybe a comedian writing poetry is the worst part of poetry</p>
							<p>I don't know, I'm not a poet</p>
							<p>I don't even know what poetry is</p>
