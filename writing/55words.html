					<h1>55 Words</h1>

					<h3>Date unknown, no prompt</h3>
					<p>Halfway along the tunnel, she stops, leans against the wall. Midway between the phoney palm reader and the blind drummer, this is her place. Plenty of business types with unwanted change in their suit pockets, unthinking in their charity.</p>
					<p>She sits, prostrate, her shame and her life spilling beneath the marching feet of the pedestrians.</p>
					<h3>2016-02-09, no prompt</h3>
					<p>I like dogs. I like them because they lick my hand and sometimes they smile. We had a dog but then mummy said it was daddy's and we couldn't have it any more.</p>
					<p>I don't like cats. Brandon has a cat and he says I can't touch it and mum says do whatever Brandon says.</p>
					<h3>2016-02-10, vampire</h3>
					<p>"Well, looking at your symptoms here - lowered haemoglobin levels, photosensitivity, hints of porphyria - the signs are clear, Mr. Lee: you're turning into a vampire."</p>
					<p>"A vampire?"</p>
					<p>"I'm afraid so."</p>
					<p>"That is … so rad!"</p>
					<p>"Oh, I forgot to mention, you are beginning to show signs of luxodermititis - sparkly skin."</p>
					<p>"You mean?"</p>
					<p>"I'm afraid so."</p>
					<p>"Noooooo!"</p>
					<h3>2016-02-11, hotel</h3>
					<p>"Hey Vern? Do you reckon there's a reason why we always get called out to the seediest hotels?"</p>
					<p>"Well, no-one's gonna commit a murder in the Ritz, are they now?"</p>
					<p>"What if they do, and it never gets reported?"</p>
					<p>"Well then it just ain't our problem, Al. We're here to do what we're told, okay?"</p>
					<h3>2016-02-12, jockey</h3>
					<p>Thundering down the track. Furious grunting, eager whinnying, riders shouting, the whip slapping the back of Desdemona's hide.</p>
					<p>Atop her back, Brian calls to her: "We've got this, Des! We can do it!"</p>
					<p>Minutes later, the crowd cheering, Brian waving, photographers snapping photos of him on the winner's pedestal.</p>
					<p>Brian shouts: "I did it! Woo!"</p>
					<h3>2016-02-15, vision</h3>
					<p>"Jane? Jane, oh God!"</p>
					<p>"Everyone stand back! Give her space!"</p>
					<p>"There's no pulse."</p>
					<p>"Jane, don't go! Please. Don't leave me! I love you too much."</p>
					<p>Jane sees the image in her head, as it flows from the Doctor's mouth into her ears.</p>
					<p>But she doesn't feel any of it. Maybe she really did die yesterday.</p>
					<h3>2016-02-16, sphere</h3>
					<p>The globe smashes against the wall, the tiny Eiffel tower crushed and lost among the loud crash and the explosion of fake snow.</p>
					<p>He slumps by the chaos, crying tears for the lovely woman who would grace the streets of Paris no longer, as the artificial snowflakes of memory sink lazily through the afternoon sunlight.</p>
					<h3>2016-02-17, London</h3>
					<p>"And how's London going, sweetie?"</p>
					<p>Elaine considers her image in the Skype window. Her frizzy hair fills most of the little rectangle, but she can still see the disappointing afternoon sky behind her. A couple of pixels flicker, showing a gray pigeon swooping past a gray concrete building, completing the gray backdrop.</p>
					<p>"It's swell, ma."</p>
					<h3>2016-02-18, vulnerable</h3>
					<p>"You think you've won, Grand Crusader… but I still have a secret weapon!"</p>
					<p>"Give it up, dear Sister Sinister. I've bested you! There's nothing that can prevent my Crusade of Justice!"</p>
					<p>*click*</p>
					<p>"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me…"</p>
					<p>"No! My one weakness!"</p>
					<p>"Yes! Early 2000's alternative rock band Smash Mouth!"</p>
					<p>"Noooo!"</p>
					<h3>2016-02-19, empty</h3>
					<p>"Once upon a time there was a dragon that lived in a big mountain.</p>
					<p>"The terrible beast terrorised the nearby town, and many were lost.</p>
					<p>"Until one day our hero decided that the town should just move away from the mountain.</p>
					<p>"Without a reliable source food, the dragon perished, and now the mountain is empty."</p>
					<h3>2016-02-22, Titanic</h3>
					<p>Mary lounges precariously by the boat's aft, skillfully ignoring her mother's concerned gaze.</p>
					<p>"It is awfully boring on this big boat."</p>
					<p>"Hush, child! This is the largest sea vessel ever built! There's simply no better way of reaching the Americas."</p>
					<p>Mary's sigh is barely audible over the wind.</p>
					<p>"Come inside, Maryanne. It's getting cold out."</p>
					<h3>2016-02-23, jury</h3>
					<p>"Fine people of the jury. My client comes before you a remorseful man, a contrite soul.</p>
					<p>"I ask you: would not we each do as my client did? However deplorable his actions, they were undeniably for good.</p>
					<p>"However you decide, please, think of your own children, and my client's children, those he could not save."</p>
					<h3>2016-02-24, Dom</h3>
					<p>"Look, Dominic," Mr. Cassius started. His real name was Alex, but no-one called him that. "We like you here. You're eager, nice to the guests, and most importantly, punctual."</p>
					<p>Dom grinned at the compliments.</p>
					<p>"But, you're just too brutish. Even the staff find you anticipating. Maybe concierge and bouncer...they're more dissimilar than we expected."</p>
					<p>Dom's grin fades.</p>
					<h3>2016-02-25, Church</h3>
					<p>It was many years until the church served as a place of calm once more. There was undoubtable beauty in the creeping, pervading vines, but that was not peace.</p>
					<p>No, peace wasn't achieved until the little wandering girl (who the church learned was named Emily) arrived, nestled herself beneath the crumbling apse, and began reading.</p>
					<h3>2016-02-26, jackdaw</h3>
					<p>Möngke dropped the sack of grain and stared at the bird. It was a jackdaw, and had flown far from the west, but Möngke could not have known that.</p>
					<p>He only leered at the sleek black thing, marvelling quietly at its strange, grey eyes, as grey as the rain that spills over the the mountains.</p>
					<h3>2016-02-29, World Series</h3>
					<p>"Hey Mister!"</p>
					<p>Drew blows the whistle, and turns to see the man already stomping past first base.</p>
					<p>"Are you blind?" he shouts, blustering in his sweat-caked Dodgers shirt. "That was miles outta the strike zone! How dare you call a strike against my son!"</p>
					<p>"Sir, this ain't the Little League - it's the World Series! Security!"</p>
					<h3>2016-03-01, speech</h3>
					<p>Simone cheers when Tabitha's name is announced. She looks perfect in the outfit they'd picked from the shop window, and her frizzy curls had disappeared after hours of brushing.</p>
					<p>On stage, Tabitha barely reaches the microphone.</p>
					<p>"My speech is about my hero, my dad."</p>
					<p>Simone stands quietly beside the vacant chair with the "Reserved" sign.</p>
					<h3>2016-03-02, key</h3>
					<p>Saltbreath Sam unravels the map. It's old and stained, with details barely perceptible beneath smatterings of mud, rum and a curious red stain.</p>
					<p>He cradles his valued treasure. This is the secret none of his men could ever find out.</p>
					<p>He discards the map, opens the locket, and fingers the lock of silky hair within.</p>
					<h3>2016-03-03, blueprints</h3>
					<p>The atrium is filled with so many sounds. The ominous whirring of the laser sensors, the booming echo of his wristwatch, the screeching of the rope above him.</p>
					<p>Focus. Focus, you big dummy. Focus!</p>
					<p>He struggles to calm the giant roar of his panting breath, but it's no use. He just can't recall the blueprints.</p>
					<h3>2016-03-04, astrology</h3>
					<p>"Oh my god! You're such a Leo!"</p>
					<p>"You don't honestly believe in that astrology nonsense, do you now?"</p>
					<p>Bethany giggles. "Well, sometimes it's just obvious, you know?"</p>
					<p>Steve runs a paw through his regal mane, rolling his eyes, and flashing a toothy grin.</p>
					<p>"Well, my birthday is December 13th, so you're off a tad, dear."</p>
					<h3>2016-03-07, tortoise</h3>
					<p>"Mummy, look! A tortoise!"</p>
					<p>"Technically, small human, I'm an Eastern long-necked turtle, not a "tortoise" as you eagerly claimed, although such ignorance is typical from a species that insists on labelling every organism on this infinitely varied Earth, yet lacks the imagination to name me without referencing yet another reptile."</p>
					<p>"Mummy! It's hissing at me!"</p>
					<h3>2016-03-08, contract</h3>
					<p>"I'm sorry sir, you've been served."</p>
					<p>Anthony studies the old man inside the door frame, or rather, his reaction. The weight of realisation crushes the frail retiree, his entire face sags. Normally there's anger, or frustration, or some primal 'flight' attempt, but not here.</p>
					<p>"I really am sorry."</p>
					<p>"It's fine, son. Just doing your job."</p>
					<h3>2016-03-09, government</h3>
					<p>Suzie remembers when she marched, back in the 60's. She sees the same spirit in the faces of the young people now, walking against war, famine or injustice.</p>
					<p>She'd love to say that her fight was a real fight, that her cause was a noble one, but she's old enough to know there's no difference.</p>
					<h3>2016-03-10, Lauren</h3>
					<p>Sun reaching through sandy blonde hair, beating down on the paperback with brilliant glare.</p>
					<p>Eyes of rockpool blue, her gaze wafting back and forth across the page like a tugging seabreeze.</p>
					<p>Pages folding like waves, the story rolling out into the future.</p>
					<p>Fingers play idly in wait for the next turn, rubbing smooth her thumb.</p>
					<h3>2016-03-11, cows</h3>
					<p>Daisy runs her hoof across Bessy's shiny hair, as her friend sobs so loudly that moos of concern can be heard from outside the barn.</p>
					<p>"I'm going to be eaten!"</p>
					<p>"Nooo! You make the best milk on the farm! And little Alice loves you so.</p>
					<p>"Ignore the steaks, be the best cow you can be."</p>
					<h3>2016-03-14, house</h3>
					<p>"So! You're going to live in a Mansion-"</p>
					<p>"Yess!"</p>
					<p>"-drive a wagon and have 700 babies-"</p>
					<p>"Nooo!"</p>
					<p>"-with Destin Tramonte! Ewwww!"</p>
					<p>"Alright girls, bedtime."</p>
					<p>"But it's my turn! I want to find out my future too!"</p>
					<p>"With a game? Why not make your own future?"</p>
					<p>Jenny flips the eraser.</p>
					<p>"It says 'NO'. Eraser's never wrong."</p>
					<h3>2016-03-15, open</h3>
					<p>"-marks a great day for this city-"</p>
					<p>My arms are tired. Who makes scissors this big? Is there a giant-sized stationery store?</p>
					<p>"-inauguration of the Clive Hensen House will-"</p>
					<p>Listen to this buffoon. "Clive". Thinks he's some kind of homeless hero.</p>
					<p>"-my friend, Buster, to cut the ceremonial ribbon!"</p>
					<p>Friend. Pfft. I'm just a symbol.</p>
					<h3>2016-03-16, worried</h3>
					<p>The dry-cleaning's gotta be picked up, but the kids'll be out at 3, maybe I can swing by on my way, wait, no!, then Stacey's cupcakes will burn!, I must've forgotten something- oh!, it's been four hours!, where's my wallet?, and my water bottle? oh, I can swallow them dry, that's better. Much better. Phew.</p>
					<h3>2016-03-17, comets</h3>
					<p>Caroline adjusts the eyepiece and nestles in for another sweep.</p>
					<p>The telescope was a gift from her brother. Inferior to those at the Royal Society, but altogether sufficient. She could seat herself in the middle of the field, scouring the skies for any glints of discovery.</p>
					<p>Not for her brother, or the Society. For her.</p>
					<h3>2016-03-18, director</h3>
					<p>"And...CUT! That's a wrap, people!"</p>
					<p>Four days later, Danny is reviewing the footage. His is the last trailer in the lot. His mobile buzzes again, but he doesn't notice - he's transfixed by his laptop's buzzing display.</p>
					<p>His stubby finger taps, the screen refreshes, he just he stares.</p>
					<p>"Files not found."</p>
					<p>His phone buzzes again.</p>
					<h3>2016-03-21, powerful</h3>
					<p>"This, ma'am, is the BMW M4 Coupe. Over four hundred horsepower, three point three thousand pounds of pure distinction and class."</p>
					<p>Aaron puts the woman at 50 years old, but her dress says 30. Tight bun, shiny heels, slight squint. He knows this woman - it's his job.</p>
					<p>"It's nice," she purrs. "But I want bigger."</p>
					<h3>2016-03-22, distant</h3>
					<p>It's been almost 4 months since papa left. Cal's the only one left to work the farm, selling in the morning, droving under the midday sun, churning away long past dark. His sister's too weak to help, and his mother only cries, cursing the weather, the war, and even papa, everyone who'd done her wrong.</p>
					<h3>2016-03-23, defensive</h3>
					<p>It was like the entire battalion suddenly went silent.</p>
					<p>"Look, I'm not saying they're all like that-"</p>
					<p>"Don't even, Henrick."</p>
					<p>"That's more disgusting than this gruel."</p>
					<p>"What? I'm allowed opinions!"</p>
					<p>"We may be in the middle of a war with these bastards, but that's no reason to disrespect them!"</p>
					<p>"That's it. Latrine duty for you."</p>
					<h3>2016-03-24, pop and lock</h3>
					<p>Julian steps into the circle, weaving wide around the centre, like a tiger around prey. Everyone is chanting. His brother is right there, wearing his hand-me-down Nash jersey, punching the air in glee.</p>
					<p>How could you even think about homework, or family, or anything not in the circle.</p>
					<p>This is everything. This is his jam.</p>
					<h3>2016-03-25, stadium</h3>
					<p>Dozens of trash collectors sweep through the stadium like scavengers after a kill, like ants on the ribcage of a bested beast. Screams of joy and desperation are replaced with an eerie silence, a low whistling that dwells in the bowl of the arena.</p>
					<p>One player remains, practicing sprints at the epicentre of this aftermath.</p>
					<h3>2016-03-28, time zone</h3>
					<p>"I'm telling you: divorce is hard.</p>
					<p>"I mean, it's been, what, 2 years? And I still regret it. Not what I did to Kerry, but that I didn't try harder for our kid.</p>
					<p>"You know the worst part? The time difference. I have to wait up all night just to talk to my own son."</p>
					<h3>2016-03-29, showdown</h3>
					<p>Derrick glares from the doorway as Aaron sticks his award to the fridge.</p>
					<p>"See this," Aaron declares. "This shows how good I am at football."</p>
					<p>"They give you too much credit. Oh wait, they didn't. That's just participation."</p>
					<p>With that, Derrick pulls out his report card. Four gold stars. Four.</p>
					<p>Aaron glowers. "It. Is. On."</p>
					<h3>2016-03-30, chocolate</h3>
					<p>Achcauhtli pours the drink back and forth, and then finally offers the goblet with a grin.</p>
					<p>Iccauhtli stares at the liquid inside - a dirty, swirling pulp. There are bean shards floating in the crude mixture.</p>
					<p>"Go on, brother, try some!"</p>
					<p>"Are you sure, brother? I've heard bad things-"</p>
					<p>"Friend! Cacao is for kings! Us too!"</p>
					<h3>2016-03-31, cafeteria</h3>
					<p>Laila hesitates at the window, but Samir grabs her and pulls her in.</p>
					<p>The diner is deserted and eerie, but the smell of fries and grease lingers from the day's business.</p>
					<p>Samir already has the pizza box open, and is grinning through a mouthful of cheesy pepperoni.</p>
					<p>"Don't worry! I got you."</p>
					<p>Laila smiles back.</p>
					<h3>2016-04-01, genuine</h3>
					<p>He looked nothing like his profile picture. Stephanie was expecting someone with fewer wrinkles, less tummy, more hair.</p>
					<p>But that was the thing. He knew he'd lied, and she knew too, and yet nothing was said. He was unashamed, smiling broadly, laughing genuinely and offering to pay for her taxi home. Not the worst date.</p>
					<h3>2016-04-04, slings</h3>
					<p>After every shift Loretta sits outside the barracks and cries. Matron Perry caught her crying in front of the patients once, and Loretta was smacked for that, and then she cried some more. Yesterday she amputated the leg of a boy as young as her brother, and afterwards they cried together.</p>
					</p>How could you not?</p>
