							exolve-preamble:
								<p>The previous mini-crosswords were themed around a few of my favourite things, and this crossword is no different. Among the clues, 7 are wordplay-only, 30 have had a letter replaced by another, and 5 are otherwise normal. The following steps are best approached one at a timeâ€¦</p>
								<ol>
									<li>The answers to the <span class="nina-1">wordplay-only clues</span> are all members of a set of items that can be ranked with a formal scale. If each item is ranked n within this set of items, the middle letters of the nth word in each clue (in clue order) for a name that identifies each item. The first letters of each clue, and then the last letters of each clue (also in clue order) will further identify the items.</li>
									<li>The (current) definitive first member of the full set of Step 1 items is represented by a symbol (henceforth referred to as Symbol X). Symbol X is also part of another set of items, the same ones that were added to the previous mini-crosswords. However, the crossword that <i>should</i> have added Symbol X instead involved creating its opposite symbol (thinking outside the box). Take the four extracted strings from the previous crosswords and place them in the same method used in Symbol X's crossword (starting at the top, in the order of the symbols). Got all that? Excellent. Mark this step with Symbol X once you're ready to move on.</li>
									<li>For each <span class="nina-3">clue with a replaced letter</span>, the original and replaced letters form starting points in the strings added in Step 2, from which to shoot orthogonal lines - these lines will intersect at a grid letter. Those grid letters (in order of their respective clues) will reveal instructions for how to find both why I seek out the items from Step 1, and either:
									<ul>
										<li>an 8th item for the set from Step 1</li>
										<li>a description of what you added in Step 2</li>
										<li>what results from the items from Step 1 (sorry)</li>
									</ul></li>
									<li>The <span class="nina-4">remaining clues</span> each contains their own special addition. The letters immediately before and after the additions (in clue order) spell out either:
									<ul>
										<li>linguistically, what these additions represent (especially in response to the items from Step 1)</li>
										<li>literally, what you found in Step 3</li>
										<li>cryptically, when prefaced by the name from Step 1, the final addition to my set of favourite things!</li>
									</ul></li>
