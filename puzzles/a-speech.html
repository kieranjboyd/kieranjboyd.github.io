							exolve-preamble:
								<p>It's time for a speech to celebrate the new year! But not just any speech…<\p>
								<ol>
									<li>One grid entry (word #1) describes our speaker. When spoken aloud, it reveals the characters to add after both halves of 2 other clue answers before entry in the grid. (It also describes the majority of the speech.) <span class="nina-1">Definitions for the new entries</span> can be found in their respective clues.</li>
									<li>Another grid entry (word #2) describes the how the speaker feels … but not the stage (the speaker is surrounded by some hidden characters).</li>
									<ol type="a">
										<li>When spoken aloud, it reveals the <span class="nina-2">characters</span> in 2 other clue answers that are to be made hidden in their corresponding grid entries.</li>
										<li>You can also apply that change to a word in each corresponding clue, if you like. It's your choice!</li>
									</ol>
									<li>The remaining six clues are each missing <span class="nina-3">a character</span> (to be replaced before solving), which together spell the name of our speaker. Hopefully by now you might guess the speech.)</li>
								</ol>
								<p>Now it's my time to respond. If you apply [change #2] to the name of the speaker, you will find someone described by [word #1], and who inspired me to start this website. If you apply [change #1] to <i>that</i> person's name, you will find someone who doesn't understand why my website has been so [word #2] recently.</p>

								<p>While <span class="nina-1">HAMLET</span> might question "To be, or not to be" (or is that 2b, or not 2b?), there's no question that I've had help in my time from both <a href="https://maxwoghiren.com/puzzles/">HALE</a> and <a href="http://www.puzzazz.com/gold">HAYLEY</a>.<p>
