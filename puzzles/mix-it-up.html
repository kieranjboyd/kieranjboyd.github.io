							exolve-preamble:
								<p>This cryptic requires that you mix it up by using a classic letter-number system.<\p>
								<p>For most of the entries, one letter needs to be replaced by a number in the grid - this same change has been applied to one word in each corresponding clue.<\p>
								<p>In the remaining clues, the cryptic part ignores a number that needs to be added to the grid entry - to help identify these omissions, the cryptic part is surrounded by the definitions for both the incomplete and complete answers.<\p>
								<p>Once the grid is complete, these omissions, when translated back into letters and read in order, will tell you what's missing from the grid, and what these numbers can't represent, paradoxically.<\p>
							exolve-question: What is missing from the grid? (10)* NADA
