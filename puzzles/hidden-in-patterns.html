							exolve-preamble:
								<p>Use the clues to fill the grid, which will reveal a particular pattern, or shape.</p>
								<p>For the answers that intersect this shape, look for all instances of that same shape in the corresponding clues. Then look at what comes directly after each instance, combined. This will give you some new clues, which can be used to solve the spaces in the grid again.</p>
								<p>Then, consider the unchanged answers that didn't intersect with the shape. Find that shape in the corresponding clues, and take the positions for each clue. Pair these clues together, and use these as co-ordinates of letters in the new grid.</p>
								<p>Then you will find a two word solution that is the best time to solve this puzzle.</p>
