								<p>Huh? Yeah â€¦ what <i>is</i> it good for?<\p>
								<p>In certain grid cells that split the battlefield, the Across and Down entries are in conflict. Each such entry features an item from a famous list of competitors (which hopefully won't be updated soon). Instead of the letters from the clue answers, enter the outcome for each Down entry's competitor (all impacted entries will still be valid words). The letters from the losing entries will spell out a thematic loss that you can share.</p>
								<p>A number of other cells (where such violent competition isn't possible) are keeping score for the competition, in a traditional location. For each such cell, identify the word in the corresponding clue that starts with the cell's letter, and note the last letter of that word. The noted letters will, in clue order, spell out a pacifist justification from each of these cells, and will (depending if you apply punctuation) provide one of two explanations for why I too have been conflict-free recently.</p>

							exolve-question: What was lost? (10)* (THE) GAME
							exolve-question: What is the final justification? (20)* I'M CO(-)OPED UP
							exolve-explanations:
								<p>Hidden in the clues for the 8 central grid entries you can find the names of 8 board games. Their rankings on the <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame"</a>Board Game Geek Top 100 List</a> (at time of publication, at least!) indicate that the Down entries should win ("W"), whereas the Across entries have lost the "GAME" (as have you, sorry).</p>
								<p>The final letters of the words in the other clues explain why I've been conflict-free: "I'M COOPED UP" (during recent lockdowns) and "I'M CO-OPED UP" - especially thanks to <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205637/arkham-horror-card-game">Arkham Horror LCG</a> and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/255984/sleeping-gods"</a>Sleeping Gods</a>!</p>
