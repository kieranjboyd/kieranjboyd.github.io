							exolve-preamble:
								<p>Welcome to your free improv taster! Let's split into two groups and try some exercises.<\p>
								<ol>
									<li>You've probably already heard the two-word mantra that some consider the first rule of improv. Half of the clues must (cryptically) implement that rule before entry in the grid, which means that their enumerations are a little off. Oops!</li>
									<li>The other half of the clues have responded with some interesting moves (in a similarly cryptic way). In clue order, the first letters of the words involved spell out what there was at first, and then what these have become!</li>
									<li>Let's wrap things up with a third beat. Each time the character from the first activity appears as the nth character in a grid entry, highlight nth character in its clue. (This is turning into a bit of a character island...) Those letters, in clue order, spell what most improvisers want to achieve from this hobby, but applying our first step reveals what they actually do instead.</li>
								</ol>
							exolve-question: What was there at first/What have they become? (20)* GAFFES/OFFERS
							exolve-question: What do improvisers (actually) do? (20)* (Y)EARN HEAPS
							exolve-nina: nina-hidden #F08080
							exolve-nina: nina-strikethrough  #90EE90
							exolve-nina: a6 b4 c2 e5 f6 steelblue
							exolve-nina: nina-3 lightsteelblue
							exolve-explanations:
								<p>The first rule of improv (arguably) is 'Yes And', so well done to the first group for prepending Y to your answers in the grid.</p>
								<p>Great work to the second group for heeding the advice of Second City alum Tina Fey - there are no mistakes in improv, only opportunities.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, while you might think that your new skill will help you EARN HEAPS ... no. But you'll likely still YEARN HEAPS!</p>
