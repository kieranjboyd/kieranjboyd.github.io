							exolve-preamble:
								<p>Having spent the (Victorian) Labour Day long weekend in bed with a terrible cold, my illness has spilled into my crossword making.<\p>
								<p>Half the clues have come down with something: they're either off-colour, under the weather, or have a splitting head(ache), in equal proportions. Unfortunately this means their answers don't match their listed enumeration.<\p>
								<p>To get the point across, each of the other half has been infected by a nasty bug in the form of an extra word. Together these words, in order, produce a final cryptic clue (with enumeration), whose surface describes how I'll be spending the long weekend next year (hopefully), and whose answer describes my experience this year.<\p>
							exolve-question: What is the extra clue? (50)* Very active with flu shot (5)
							exolve-question: How is my experience this year described? (50)* AWFUL
