						exolve-preamble:
							<p>Hopefully you've figured it out, but the above two paragraphs are in fact sets of Across and Down cryptic clues combined together. The required grid is 6×6 (of course), and has "no middle bars".</p>
							<p>This was a fun one to make. SPIETH and SHAFTS were my seeds (to make the first sentence work, and reference "bars" in the second paragraph), and the fill was pretty constrained from there. Thanks to <a href="http://pixpuzzles.blogspot.com/">Pixlate</a> for test-solving!</p>

				<p>Strangely, this puzzle (on the surface) gives old-timey notes. It's a vehicle for conflict, combining a sign of activity with the sign of peace. A master in the habit of book-keeping may at heart be speechless, gutted. In this case, after fluid, lighter parts … this "brigade" is missing even parts for bones. At first, standard crossword elements need elucidating, such as 2D displays.</p>
				<p>But you see, such a fine trellis with no middle bars - it's open, constant, and club shaped. Take in the cores of multimedia, mobile labels - they contain seeds of change in estate. Well, I need head to make good night briefly. In the end, although the format's ambiguous, hope this works, from one crossword-y author.</p>
