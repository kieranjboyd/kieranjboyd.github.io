							exolve-preamble:
								<p>It's the holiday season! Some people enjoy singing festive numbers, others appreciate giving presents - this crossword features both!</p>
								<ol>
									<li>A number of clues have been gifted one festive present from a particular origin. Each present is (in some cases, aptly) gallivanting about, and should be ignored when solving the clue. The first letters (origins) of the unchanged clues, when arranged according to the numbers corresponding to the presents, will reveal either (i) the origin of these presents, OR (ii) the origin of all these numbers, in part.</li>
									<li>For another number of potentially trickier clues, the cryptic part wraps the correct answer in a number of extra letters. These letters, in clue order, are either (i) a potential reason for all the presents from (1), OR (ii) a potential description for a number of cells in the final grid.</li>
									<li>The remaining clues deliver the final challenge. In each, the cryptic part is missing a letter, which should be circled in the grid. When read in a particular order, the circled letters reveal either (i) someone who famously delivered festive numbers, and whose birthday features another festive number, OR (ii) the location where one famous birthday present was delivered.</li>
								</ol>
							exolve-question: What is the origin of the presents/numbers? (60)* (YOUR TRUE) LOVE
