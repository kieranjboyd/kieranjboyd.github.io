								<p>It's the holiday season! Some people enjoy singing festive numbers, others appreciate giving presents - this crossword features both!</p>
								<ol>
									<li>A number of clues have been gifted one festive present from a particular origin. Each present is (in some cases, aptly) gallivanting about, and should be ignored when solving the clue. The first letters (origins) of the unchanged clues, when arranged according to the numbers corresponding to the presents, will reveal either:</li>
									<ol type="i">
										<li>the origin of these presents, OR</li>
										<li>the origin of all these numbers, in part.</li>
									</ol>
									<li>For another number of potentially trickier clues, the cryptic part wraps the correct answer in a number of extra letters. These letters, in clue order, are either</li>
									<ol type="i">
										<li>a potential reason for all the presents from (1), OR</li>
										<li>a potential description for a number of cells in the final grid.</li>
									</ol>
									<li>The remaining clues deliver the final challenge. In each, the cryptic part is missing a letter, which should be circled in the grid. When read in a particular order, the circled letters reveal either</li>
									<ol type="i">
										<li>someone who famously delivered festive numbers, and whose birthday features another festive number, OR</li>
										<li>the location where one famous birthday present was delivered.</li>
									</ol>
								</ol>
							exolve-question: What is the origin of the presents/numbers? (60)* (YOUR TRUE) LOVE
							exolve-question: What is a potential reason for the presents/potential description of the cells? (60)* ONE GROSS MISUNDERSTANDING
							exolve-question: What is the identify of the famous individual/location of the present? (60)* FRANK SINATRA/STARK INN AFAR

							exolve-explanations:
								<ol>
									<li>Twelve clues feature an item received during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song)">Twelve Days of Christmas</a>, anagrammed. For example, 22D begins with "Ol' Dr", which is one of the ten LORDs 'leaping'. The first letters spell out YOUR TRUE LOVE (the donor of these gifts). In some circumstances, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/love#Noun_2">LOVE means zero</a> - the start of all the numbers in the song.</li>
									<li>The letters wrapping the second set of answers spell out ONE GROSS MISUNDERSTANDING. The grid features 12 dozen cells (a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gross#Noun">gross</a>), while the excessive gifts in the song seem like a horrible mix-up.</li>
									<li>The missing letters are identified in the grid, and spell either FRANK SINATRA (who is famous for his Christmas crooning, and less so for his birthday of the 12/12) or STARK INN AFAR (where, according to Christian literature, baby Jesus was born).</li>
