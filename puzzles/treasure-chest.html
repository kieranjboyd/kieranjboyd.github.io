							exolve-preamble:
								<p>Congratulations, you've found a chest! This one's divided into sections, and the value of its contents is a matter of perspective…<\p>
								<p>The first set of clues (listed alphabetically) are all six letters long, and must be entered into the chest to form a symmetrical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square">word square</a>.<\p>
								<p>The answers for the second set of clues (also listed alphabetically) are to be entered into the sections of the chest, with placement determined from the completed grid, and with letters arranged out of order … but each of the answers is one letter too long.<\p>
								<p>Matching those extra letters to their sections, from one perspective they describe each section, and from another perspective they identify what you get for all your hard work!</p>
							exolve-explanations:
								This puzzle was rather tricky to create - Python code was needed to find a satisfying word square whose sections could anagram with the target answers into new words. It was like going on my own hunt for treasure!
							exolve-question: What describes each section? (10)* DRAWER
							exolve-question: What do you receive? (10)* REWARD
							exolve-colour: goldenrod a1 a2 a5 a6 b1 b2 b5 b6 c1 c2 c5 c6 d3 d4 e3 e4 f3 f4
							report-bug:
								The placeholder for clue C is only wide enough for the first 4 characters, before the space, although the full answer can be entered
