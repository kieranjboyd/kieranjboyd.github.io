							exolve-preamble:
								<p>This crossword honours my favourite hobby - at least the one I do the most often.<\p>
								<p>Three clues have been affected by this activity, and must be corrected before solving. This same alteration has been applied to the remaining grid entries (all grid entries are still valid words). The impacted letters, in clue order, <i>almost</i> spell what I aim to do when performing this activity.</p>
								<p>Reading across the final grid, you will find an informal term for my hobby, and (using some code) the necessary requirement (both cryptically and literally) to achieve my hobby!<\p>
							exolve-question: What is the missing element? (20)* TIME
							exolve-question: What is my (complete) goal? (20)* RES(T) GENTLY
							exolve-nina: steelblue b2 b3 c3 d4 d5 e3 e5 f3 f4 clue-nina-1
							exolve-nina: clue-nina-2 gold
							exolve-explanations:
								<p>My favourite hobby is sleeping - colloquially, having a ZIZZ, as per the altered 9 Across entry. Letters have been replaced with Zs (the sound of snoring) - the original clue letters spell RESGENTLY. By listening to the snores coming from the Zs in the grid rows, and applying Morse code, you get TIME - the missing element needed to REST GENTLY.</p>
